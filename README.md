Work in progress. ~~Mobile Device Group and~~ User Group equivalents soon to come.

The Ebooks and iOS App sections work in their current states but including them makes the script take considerably longer to run - from ~seconds without either deliverable to ~minutes when included, even in small environments. Anecdotally from my test server: searching thru 19 iOS apps added 17 minutes and change and searching thru my one lone ebook added about 8 minutes to script run time.

Re-evaluation plans/considerations for future revisions:
- Returning Smart Group ID number along with Smart Group Name for easier correction via Stupid Groups App.
- Modifying Ebooks and iOS App sections for improved efficiency.

Stay tuned.
