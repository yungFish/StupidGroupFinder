# StupidGroupFinder

Version 1 now complete!

These scripts were designed to locate any Smart Computer/Device/User Groups in your Jamf Pro server that aren't in the scope of any of your deliverables. Once these groups are found, they can be simply deleted or repurposed as desired using Mike Levenick's 'Stupid Groups' app (found here: https://github.com/mike-levenick/stupid-groups/releases) to eliminate the strain of these unnecessary group membership calculations on your server.

Group IDs are now returned for easier correction via Stupid Groups app. Group names with special characters should now be handled properly.

Any comments, tips, feedback, recommendations, etc are always welcome.

Stay tuned.
