# StupidGroupFinder

Version 0.1 now complete! Future updates and improvements still to come.

These scripts were designed to locate any Smart Computer/Device/User Groups in your Jamf Pro server that aren't in the scope of any of your deliverables. Once these groups are found, they can be simply deleted or repurposed as desired using Mike Levenick's 'Stupid Groups' app (found here: https://github.com/mike-levenick/stupid-groups/releases) to eliminate the strain of these unnecessary group membership calculations on your server.

Any comments, tips, feedback, recommendations, etc are always welcome.

To-do list:
- Return Smart Group ID Number along with Smart Group Name for easier correction via Stupid Groups App.

Stay tuned.
